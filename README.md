# Project: Learning Angular

I started this project as a playground to practice Angular.
This is now an Angular Web App with sections, exercises with solutions and many projects!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Instructions

Clone or download the repository to your local machine, `cd` in the folder and run `npm install` (you need Node.js `https://nodejs.org` ).

## To launch the application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Content

I am adding content as I am learning!
